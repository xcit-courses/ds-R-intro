Programming is the "glue" that binds all of these steps.

## Freedom and empowerment

-   You are restricted when using "tools" developed by others;

-   If you learn to create your own "tools", the possibilities become endless.

-   You will gain in efficiency and freedom (you can delegate work to computers).

-   You will better understand the digital world.

## Learning by doing

This is a hands-on course!
